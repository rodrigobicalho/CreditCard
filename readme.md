## Welcome to my Credit Card page

I discovered an amazing dataset on [UCI Machine Learning Website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients) developed by professor I-Cheng Yeh. His paper was trying a lot of different machine learning methods to see which works best to predict Credit Card defaults.

In order to improve my Machine Learning Skills, I decided to try various methods to see if I can get a good predictive model for this situation.

The citation for the official papper is as following:
```markdown
Yeh, I. C., & Lien, C. H. (2009). The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients. Expert Systems with Applications, 36(2), 2473-2480.
```

Welcome!
